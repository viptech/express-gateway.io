It's true, we've slowed down on Express Gateway. Why? We've been pretty busy supporting developers deploying instances of Express Gateway on production environments. We are thrilled at this opportunity, but like any other open source project we've found a few edge cases. So, where to go from here?

<!--excerpt-->

Please welcome Express Gateway 1.7.3 where we have collected some edge cases and put solutions to those edgecases into this release. BOOM!

## JSON Web Tokens (JWT) got an upgrade

Last week we posted all about getting started with JSON Web Tokens, so this release has some extra special love for JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Now, when you validate an external JWT and `checkCredentialExistence` flag is `false`, the gateway will set the received JWT as the current user object. This makes it easy to directly extract the information you care about instead of creating an anonymous user.

*Information. You. Care. About.*

So, to round out the updates to JWT - you can specify the `algorithm` parameter that the `oAuth2` policy will use to sign the JWT token.

## JSON Schema support still in full swing

We've already announced support for JSON Schema, but we've been working hard on a few updates. For instance, we've enabled the coercing option for Express Gateway's schema validator (`ajv`). So, this means that the Gateway will  convert your data to the correct type. Additionally, this update was required in order to fully support environment variables in JSON configuration files.

Also, we improved JSON Schema for the `serviceEndpoint` with respect to `urls.` Specifically, we replaced some run time checks into the JSON Schema, specified using the right logger (`policy` instead of `logger`). In addition, we rearranged parameters so that the created `balancer` is constant (hopefully immutable).

If that's not enough, we also focused on other aspects of  the Proxy Policy such as removing unused parameters in `prepareHeaders` , deleting foreign parameters in `â€¦File `parameters and making sure the balancer strategies do not modify the current object (*as this was breaking  **All The Things***).
